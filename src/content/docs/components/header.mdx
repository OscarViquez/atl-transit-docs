The `HeaderComponent` is a versatile component used to display a title and a description in your application. It's highly customizable, allowing you to adjust its appearance based on the context it's used in.

## Appearances

The `HeaderComponent` can take on three different appearances, or "variants": `page`, `section`, and `card`. The variant determines the styling of the header.

- `page`: This is the default variant. It's suitable for page titles.
- `section`: This variant is ideal for section titles within a page.
- `card`: Use this variant for titles within a card.

## Props 

The `HeaderComponent` accepts the following props:

```ts
   /**
    * `content` is an object that represents the content of the header.
    * This property is decorated with `@Input()`, which means it's a property that can be set by a parent component.
    */
   @Input() content!: Header;

   /**
    * `variant` is a string that represents the variant of the header.
    * It can be 'page', 'section', or 'card'.
    * This property is decorated with `@Input()`, which means it's a property that can be set by a parent component.
    * If not provided, it defaults to 'page'.
    */
   @Input() variant: 'page' | 'section' | 'card' = 'page';
```
